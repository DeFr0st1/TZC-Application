# TZC-Application
Trezar coin (TZC) profit calculator and market analysis tool

This is the source code to locally run the TZC profit calculator and market analysis tool that has been hosted at https://defr0st.shinyapps.io/TZC-profit-calc/. We get 25 hours a month through the shinyapps.io site, and rather than pay for a server to host the application, I have decided to release the source code so you can run locally. The application can be launched using the open source software R https://cloud.r-project.org. The current beta version calculates hashrate profitability for the TZC coin. Massive upgrade coming by the end of January 2018, including real time market analysis of TZC compared to the other major cryptocurrencies using a database I am building that tracks prices.  

To use this application:
1) Download R at https://cloud.r-project.org

2) Launch R, open the file, highlight the source code, and click run. The next version will be executable on all OS, but if you're on linux this should work for now:

$ chmod +x Defr0st-TZC-vBeta.R 

3) A browser window should open that displays the app. Press refresh to pull in the latest market value, or re-launch the app/re-launch the source code. Whatever is easiest for you.


If you find this useful please donate to help support efforts. I am one person doing this because I like the development team and TZC coin overall.
